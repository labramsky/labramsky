<h1>Hello, I'm Lauren 👋</h1>

**Pronouns: she/her**

*I'm a Software Engineer based in London, UK. I’m passionate about connecting people and inclusive digital tools that help make society better for everyone.*


### Recent work 👩🏻‍💻  

* I was previously a software engineer at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/uk/), where I built accessible and reusable React components to help businesses manage their teams and assign licenses across Adobe products.
* Prior to this, I worked in worker-tech startups, aiming to create tools that ensure everyone is treated with respect and dignity at work. I led the React development of Organise's new [Network](https://app.organise.network/) product, used monthly by 200K+ workers to  support campaigns, take action alongside fellow workers to improve their lives at work. And at Vault Platform, I led the React development of a new online reporting tool, [Open Reporting](https://vaultplatform.com/products/open-reporting), which allows up the power of misconduct reporting to members of the public.
* Before I moved to the UK, I was an engineer and consultant at [Deloitte Digital](https://www.deloittedigital.com/ca/en.html), creating web and iOS products for clients in Canada.

### Recent activities ⚽️

* My pride and joy is being the social secretary on my local South London grassroots football team for women and non-binary folks, **Lush Lyfe FC**. I organise regular community events for the team to connect and bond on and off the pitch.
* At Adobe, I led the **Women@Adobe** network and organised events supporting women in the office, including talks on endometriosis, perimenopause, and more.
* Celebrating Women's Day, I made [Femi-List](http://www.laurenabramsky.com/femi-list/): a feminist's list of inspirational women, to amplify and celebrate their stories.
* Previously, I spoke at the [WomenTech Network's Global Conference](https://www.womentech.net/speaker/Lauren/Abramsky/57900), which unites over 100,000 women in tech from around the world. I shared my story as someone who's experienced & reported workplace harassment, and the technology we can build to empower employees through the reporting process.
