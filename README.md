<h1>Hello, I'm Lauren 👋</h1>

**Pronouns: she/her**

*I'm a Software Engineer originally from Toronto, Canada and now based in London, UK. I’m passionate about connecting people and inclusive digital tools that help make society better for everyone.*


### Recent work 👩🏻‍💻  

* I'm currently a software engineer at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/uk/), where I build accessible and reusable React components to help businesses manage their teams and assign licenses across Adobe products.
* I previously led the React development of Organise's new [Network](https://app.organise.network/) product, used monthly by 200K+ workers to  support campaigns, take action, and connect with fellow workers to improve their life at work.
* I spoke at the [WomenTech Network's Global Conference](https://www.womentech.net/speaker/Lauren/Abramsky/57900), which unites 100,000 women in tech from around the world. I shared my story as someone who's experienced & reported workplace harassment, and the technology we can build to empower employees through the reporting process.
* At Vault Platform, I led the React development of a new online reporting tool, [Open Reporting](https://vaultplatform.com/products/open-reporting), which opens up the power of reporting to members of the public.
* Celebrating Women's Day, I made [Femi-List](http://www.laurenabramsky.com/femi-list/): a feminist's list of inspirational women, to amplify and celebrate their stories.
