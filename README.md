<h1>Hello, I'm Lauren 👋</h1>

**Pronouns: she/her**

*I’m passionate about changing unequal workplace power dynamics, so that everyone can speak up safely at work.* 🗣 

I'm a Software Developer from Toronto, Canada and currently based in London, UK. I'm part of the Engineering team at [Organise](http://organise.network), where we are working to give everyone the tools, support and confidence to improve their life at work. 📣


### Recent work 👩🏻‍💻  

* I'm currently leading the React development of Organise's new [Network](https://app.organise.network/) product, used monthly by 120K+ workers to anonymously engage in workplace campaigns.
* I spoke at the [WomenTech Network's Global Conference](https://www.womentech.net/speaker/Lauren/Abramsky/57900), which unites 100,000 women in tech from around the world. I shared my story as someone who's experienced & reported workplace harassment, and the technology we can build to empower employees through the reporting process.
* I was featured in an [interview with TechTwoX](https://techtwox.com/lauren-abramsky/), a women in tech blog, where I shared my story about how I got into my field, and my advice to anyone that's ever felt they don't belong in tech.
* At Vault Platform, I led the React development of a new online reporting tool, [Open Reporting](https://vaultplatform.com/vault-open-reporting-enables-speak-up-platform-for-entire-business-ecosystem), which opens up the power of reporting to members of the public.
* Celebrating Women's Day, I made [Femi-List](http://www.laurenabramsky.com/femi-list/): a feminist's list of inspirational women, to amplify and celebrate their stories.
