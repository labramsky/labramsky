<h1>Hello, I'm Lauren 👋</h1>

*I’m passionate about making tech more inclusive, for users and creators alike.* ❤️ 

I'm a Software Developer from Toronto, Canada and currently based in London, UK. I'm part of the Engineering team at [Vault Platform](vaultplatform.com), where we are fixing workplace misconduct by empowering employees to speak up. 🗣 


### Recent work 👩🏻‍💻  

* I was recently featured in an [interview with TechTwoX](https://techtwox.com/lauren-abramsky/), a women in tech blog, where I shared my story about how I got into my field, and my advice to anyone that's ever felt they don't belong in tech.
* I'm incredibly proud to have led the front-end development of Vault's newest product, [Open Reporting](https://vaultplatform.com/vault-open-reporting-enables-speak-up-platform-for-entire-business-ecosystem), which gives the power of reporting to our clients' entire business ecosystems.
* Celebrating Women's Day this year, I made [Femi-List](http://www.laurenabramsky.com/femi-list/): a feminist's list of inspirational women, to amplify and celebrate their stories.
